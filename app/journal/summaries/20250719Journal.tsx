      summary={`The "Dark and Darker" community is abuzz with discussions primarily focused on the reintroduction of solo queues, now allowing unofficial teaming through a "party-up" emote. This change has sparked significant debate, with many players expressing frustration over the undermining of the solo experience. The sentiment is that it detracts from the individuality of solo play, with some players feeling disadvantaged when facing teamed opponents.

The community is divided, with some appreciating the dynamic of forming alliances in-game, likening it to an adventurous dungeon crawl. However, others believe this feature disrupts the core identity of solo gameplay, advocating for a separation from team-based interactions within solo modes.

The backlash against recent updates, including Hotfix 91, reflects a broader dissatisfaction with the developers' decision-making, particularly concerning game balance and feature consistency. Players have critiqued the reintroduction of "All Attributes" on jewelry and other balance changes as lacking foresight.

Despite the criticisms, there remains a segment of the community open to experimentation and the potential for interesting gameplay developments. Yet, the overarching sentiment leans toward a desire for more considerate and player-aligned updates, highlighting a need for better communication and understanding from the developers.`}
