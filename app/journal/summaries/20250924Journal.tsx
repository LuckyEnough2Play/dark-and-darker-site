      summary={`Gather 'round, ye scallywags and dungeon delvers! The "Dark and Darker" tavern is ablaze with chatter, as Season 7 teases its treasures and tribulations! 🍻

First up, the Season 7 wipe trailer has the wizards and sorcerers dancing a jig over their new muskets! Who knew arcane arts paired so well with gunpowder? "Did he just possess a skeleton?" they ask, eyes wide as a tavern wench’s smile.

Meanwhile, fighter mains are sharpening their blades and spitting on their shields. "Give us a pirate hat," they cry, "this leather cap's as charming as a troll's backside!" But hark, the slayer class beckons like a siren's song, promising glory and loot aplenty.

And over yonder, warlocks are cackling madly, brandishing their Kris daggers like it's a festival of chaos! "Meme beam is back, baby!" they shout, as dark magic crackles in the air. The Kris dagger’s return has them plotting mischief like a band of drunken goblins.

In the patch notes, "Squires to Riches" PvP mode and other tweaks have adventurers ready to dive back into the fray, eager for a Faustian Bargain or two. The tavern echoes with boasts of riches and revenge!

But not all is merry. Ironmace's patch delays have the crowd grumbling in their mugs. "Just say it's ready when it's ready," they grumble, longing for a smoother ride, like a ship on a calm sea, not a stormy one!

Lastly, the call for reworks rings loud. "Buff Tumble, and my life is yours!" proclaims one fervent soul. Bards and claws, they cry, hoping for changes that won't leave them singing the blues.

So grab your ale, brace your boots, and join the revelry. Season 7 promises to be a wild ride, full of wonder and woe! Cheers! 🏴‍☠️🎶`}
