One humorous post involves a flintlock weapon, sparking curiosity about its class compatibility or potential as a mod. Meanwhile, continuous dungeon mechanics are under scrutiny, with players frustrated by frequent third-party interruptions, particularly in High Roller (HR) solo modes. Suggestions include banning certain maps to enhance gameplay.

A whimsical idea proposes changing the water breathing potion's appearance to an empty air bottle, which resonates well with the community's sense of humor. Additionally, the marketplace's reopening has players excited about potential riches, though some lament the timing before arena features were added.

Players also express concerns about HR queueing difficulties and map preferences, proposing solutions like map banning to improve experience. Fighter class behaviors in PvP are noted for their relentless aggression, leading to amusing in-game scenarios.

Suspicion of cheating persists, with some players encountering seemingly impossible detection by opponents. Reports of bans for exploiting glitches are also circulating, highlighting the ongoing battle against unfair play. Lastly, communication issues in the game, particularly persistent DM notifications, are a common annoyance, prompting calls for better chat management.
