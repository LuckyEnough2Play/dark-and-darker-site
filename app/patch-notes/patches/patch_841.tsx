        "Fixed an issue where selected items could be deselected when using the marketplace search function.",
        "Fixed a bug that opened the incorrect DLC page.",

        "Hopefully this fixes the crash issue. It was getting pretty annoying. Personally, I was crashing at least 3 times every 2 hours.",
        "I'm not sure I see why dropping an extra Giant Bat Wing is a problem. They do have two wings after all.",
